About Me:
I am a 20 year old freelance developer based in Michigan.
I’m currently open to commissions and part time work.
I have been developing in Lua, Java, C#, C++ and SQL for well over 8 years now.
I have been a recent developer in FiveM on my own server for about 8-12 months.
Looking to collaborate on a big FiveM project.

This is the discord server I made for the FiveM server.
I currently don’t have my server running but if anyone would like to take a look at it I could privately fire it up to show you!
